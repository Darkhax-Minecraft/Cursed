## Questions and Answers
     
**How to obtain these curses?**    
Under normal circumstances curse enchantments can only be obtained through loot chests and villager trades. These are vanilla mechanics and have not been added by the mod itself. 

**Does this mess up the enchantment table?**    
Curse enchantments can not be obtained through the enchanting table under normal circumstances. This mod does **not** change this and preserves the vanilla balance. 

**Why did you make this mod?**    
This mod was created as part of MMD's annual [Spooky Jam](https://github.com/MinecraftModDevelopment/MMD-Site/blob/master/docs/events/spooky_jam_2019.md) event. Spooky Jam is an annual celebration of modding and all things spooky.

**Can you add a curse that does X?**    
Feel free to leave suggestions for this mod. Do keep in mind that I make no promises that I will add your ideas.
